# Connell's Executive ReadMe [WIP] 

*(c) All rights reserved *


#### Intention
This readme outlines how I approach about leadership and people management. The principles I describe are ideals, and I often fall short! Finally, I am, and always will be a student, with much to learn, so this is a living document whose contents may change over time.



## About me
I'm Connell. I trained as a medical doctor before branching into software engineering, product and entrepreneurship. Though today medicine takes up only a small fraction of my time, it is a huge part of who I am, and how I think. 


## Algorithms

I once worked for an ICU consultant with an acerbic wit, and who only ever wore __shorts__ – no matter the weather or time of year*. One day, over coffee in the department (wearing shorts) he suddenly declared: "Medicine is easy! just make sure the air is going in and out, and the blood is going round and round!" There was much laughter amongst the junior staff. The next day I needed his help with a deteriorating patient:


```
ME (worried): I need help... cardiac failure... GI bleed... [blah blah ...]
CONSULTANT (impassive): Is the air going in and out?
ME: (confused) ...uh, yeah...
CONSULTANT: Good. Is the blood going round and round?
Me: ...uh, well he's been transfused 9 units and the blood pressur –
CONSULTANT (interrupting): Make the blood go round and round!
```


I couldn't see it at the time, but he was on to something. The problem *was* complex, with lots of details, numbers and plot twists. But on another, deeper level, it was quite simple: the patient will die if they can't breath or if their blood pressure crashes. In crisis, I was being reminded of the basics: airway, breathing, circulation. 

\* *Except for scrub pants in the OR, the only time I saw him wearing trousers was when he had to give evidence in Coronor's court.*



## The Craft

This early lesson in algorithmic thinking was hammered home to me many more times as a doctor. Medical practice is about recognising patterns and approaching problems in a highly structured way. And yet, the profession is anything but robotic – good doctors understand people. The *craft* of medicine is about combining knowledge and technical skill with difficult, high-stakes conversations. The same lessons hold true in business leadership.

#### A diagnostic pathway for businesses:
I encourage everyone who works with me to ask hard questions often. From experience I think most of the big organisational problems can be diagnosed by asking the following:

|               | Question                        |
| --------------|---------------------------------|
| __Vision__    | Is it compelling?               |
| __Strategy__  | Is there focus?                 |
| __People__    | Are we looking after people?    |
| __Teams__     | Are we optimising for the team? |
| __Execution__ | Are we learning fast enough?    |


Organisations that get these things right, win.




## Leadership
*__Great leaders serve.__*

The archetype of the all-seeing, all-powerful, übermensch executive is bullshit. Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are extraordinary, but they are too often venerated in a way that shows no understanding of their actual gifts, and total ignorance of their weaknesses. 

The role of leader isn't to wield power, but to distribute it. Instead of amassing information and making every decision, strong leaders empower their people to take ownership. They scale their time by ensuring that decisions are made at the right level by people with the right expertise and context.

My goal is to find great people, enable them to do their best work, and to help them grow. I do all of this in the context of the team (discussed below).

I try to keep weekly 1-1s and use that time to focus on the person, not the business. There is more to life than work, though one influences the other, so I'm interested in your personal life, if you're willing to share. I'll ask about your family, interests, hobbies, what you did on the weekend and so on. When it comes to work I'll ask you to bring any problems you have, and we'll work through them together. I'll set expectations about your role, give feedback when I think something should be better, and set goals with you. I want every person to have the opportunity to be challenged, thrive and grow. Psychology safety and trust is paramount. As I am candid with you, I expect no less in return!


## Teams

*__Great companies aren't defined by heroic individuals, they are defined by incredible teams__*

Teams change the world, and so my leadership strives to be 'team-first'. I try to optimise for teams at every level: by hiring collaborative people, by setting cultural standards for inclusion, insisting on candid communication, and by empowering groups to take ownership.

Great teams are rare! Leaders need to set the right conditions, which is very hard, but the people in the team also need to put in the work. Bruce Tuckman famously developed the model of 'Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing', which describes how effective teams evolve. I refer to it often, and encourage all the teams I work with to think about it.

When it goes right, the results are amazing. Great teams embrace responsibility and accountability, they are hungry for challenges and move fast. Best of all, they celebrate their wins, commiserate their losses, and challenge themselves to get better. If you work with me, I expect you to be 100% behind the team.


## Systems

*__Optimise for alignment, not control__*

At scale communication become harder, coordination tends to break down, and departments fall into silos. It is impossible to fully mitigate these challenges, and executives cause damage when they create more processes, rules and meetings in response. The way out of this swamp is to focus on alignment. Systems thinking is a valuable toolset to manage these transitions and build scalable interfaces that deliver the outcomes the business wants. Not everyone can know everything, but everyone should know the company's strategy and be armed with enough context to do their job.



## Strategy, Planning and OKRs

*__"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything." - Dwight D. Eisenhower__*

Although plans never work out the way we hoped, the act of planning is how we decide what's important and where we should focus our efforts. Good strategy defines a clear problem and describes how the organisation intends to solve it. Done well, it results in focus, alignment, and objectives, all of which are essential for successful execution. 

Company strategy and objectives flow from the executive level downwards. But *alignment* is achieved from the bottom-up. Once the company strategy has been scrunitised, set and communicated, I enable teams and departments to set their own strategy and objectives that feed in (ownership!). 

__OKRs__ follow naturally from strategy. Their purpose is to maximise ambition, ownership, alignment, focus, and accountability over a 2-3m period. They are not a measure of team performance, and never a stick to beat people with. I like OKRs, but others frameworks exist.
