# Connells's Read Me

[WIP]

### Intention
This is a living document that outlines my approach to leadership and people. I am, and always will be a student, with much to learn. So the contents of this readme will change over time.


### About me
I trained as a medical doctor before branching into technology, product and entrepreneurship. Though today medicine takes up only a small fraction of my time, it is a huge part of who I am, and how I think. 

I once worked for an acerbic consultant (who only ever wore shorts). He was found of quipping "Medicine is simple, just make sure the air is going in and out, and the blood is going round and round." Once, when I needed advice for a deteriorating patient I had the following interaction:

```
CONSULTANT: is the air going in and out?
ME: (confused) ...uh, yeah...
CONSULTANT: Good. Is the blood going round and round?
Me: ...uh, well he's been transfused 9 units and the blood pressur â€“
CONSULTANT (interrupting): Make the blood go round and round!
```

I think about this quite often. I couldn't see it at first between my terror and bewilderment, but he was on to something. It takes a great deal of wisdom to cut through a problem so neatly. He never said his speciality (intensive care) was easy (it definitely isn't!), but he observed that on some level it is very simple: the patient dies if either their breath or blood stops.

You'll be relieved to learn in this story the patient survived. We gave more blood products and used inotropes and vasopressors to keep it going round and round. 

(Coda: the only time I saw him wearing trousers was when he had to give evidence to coroner)
