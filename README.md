# Connell's Manager ReadMe [WIP]


## Intention
This is a living document that outlines how I think about leadership and people. I am, and always will be a student, with much to learn. So the contents of this readme will change over time. Finally, understand that the prinicipals here are ideals, I often fall far short!



## About me
I'm Connell. I trained as a medical doctor before branching into technology, product and entrepreneurship. Though today medicine takes up only a small fraction of my time, it is a huge part of who I am, and how I think. 


## Algorithms

I once worked for an ICU consultant with an acerbic wit, and who only ever wore __shorts__ – no matter the weather or time of year*. One day, over coffee in the department (wearing shorts) he suddenly declared: "Medicine is easy! just make sure the air is going in and out, and the blood is going round and round!" There was much laughter amongst the junior staff. The next day I needed his help with a deteriorating patient:


```
ME (worried): I need help... cardiac failure... GI bleed... [blah blah ...]
CONSULTANT (impassive): Is the air going in and out?
ME: (confused) ...uh, yeah...
CONSULTANT: Good. Is the blood going round and round?
Me: ...uh, well he's been transfused 9 units and the blood pressur –
CONSULTANT (interrupting): Make the blood go round and round!
```


Gripped by terror, I couldn't see it at the time, but he was on to something. The problem *was* complex, with lots of details, numbers and twists in the story. But on another, deeper level, it was quite simple: the patient will die if they can't breath or if their blood pressure crashes. 

(Readers will be relieved to learn the patient survived. We gave him more blood, and used inotropes and vasopressors to keep it going round and round, buying time for the surgeons saved the day.)


\* *Except for scrub pants in the OR, the only time I saw him wearing trousers was when he had to give evidence in Coronor's court.*




## The craft

This early lesson in algorithmic thinking was hammered home to me many more times as a doctor. And yet, the profession is anything but robotic. Good doctors understand people. The art of medicine is combining knowledge and technical skills with incredibly difficult conversations. The same lessons hold true in business. 



### A viewpoint:
Most organisational problems can be diagnosed by asking the following questions.


|               | Question                        |
| --------------|---------------------------------|
| __Vision__    | Is it compelling?               |
| __People__    | Are we looking after people?    |
| __Teams__     | Are we optimising for the team? |
| __Strategy__  | Is there focus?                 |
| __Execution__ | Are we learning fast enough?    |




Organisations that get these things right, win.  



## Leadership
Great leaders serve.

The archetype of the all-seeing, all-powerful, übermensch executive is bullshit. Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are extraordinary, but they are venerated in a way that shows no understanding of their true gifts, and total ignorance of their weaknesses. 

The role of leader isn't to wield power, but to distribute it. Instead of massing information and making every decision, great leaders empower their people to take ownership. They scale their time by ensuring that decisions are made at the right level by people with the right expertise and context.

As a leader, my goal is to find great people, enable them to do their best work, and to help them grow. I do all of this in the context of the team (discussed below).

I try to keep weekly 1-1s and use that time to focus on the person, not the business. There is more to life than work, though one influences the other, so I'm interested in your personal life, if you're willing to share. I'll ask about your family, interests, hobbies, what you did on the weekend and so on. When it comes to work I'll ask you to bring any problems you have, and we'll work through them together. I'll set expectations about your role, give feedback when I think something should be better, and set goals with you. I want every person to have the opportunity to be challenged, thrive and grow. Psychology safety and trust is paramount. As I am candid with you, I expect no less in return!


## Teams
Great companies aren't defined by heroic individuals, they are defined by incredible teams. 

Teams change the world, and so leadership should strive to be 'team-first'. Optimising for teams needs to happen at every level: hiring collaborative people, setting cultural standards for inclusion and candid communication, and empowering groups to take ownership.

Great teams are rare! Leaders need to set the right conditions, which is very hard, but the people in the team also need to put in the work. Bruce Tuckman famously developed the model of 'Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing', which describes how effective teams evolve. I refer to it often, and encourage all the teams I work with to think about it.

When it goes right, the results are amazing. Great teams embrace responsibility and accountability, they are hungry for challenges and move fast. Best of all, they celebrate their wins, commiserate their losses, and challenge themselves to get better.
