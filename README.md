# Connells's Read Me [WIP]


## Intention
This is a living document that outlines my approach to leadership and people. I am, and always will be a student, with much to learn. So the contents of this readme will change over time. Finally, understand that the prinicipals here are ideals, I often fall far short!




## About me
I trained as a medical doctor before branching into technology, product and entrepreneurship. Though today medicine takes up only a small fraction of my time, it is a huge part of who I am, and how I think. 




### Algorithms

I once worked for an ICU consultant whose image is etched into my for two reasons. Firstly, when not wearing scrubs, he only ever wore __shorts__ – no matter the weather or time of year*. Second, he had an acerbic wit that you didn't want to be on the wrong end of. One day, over coffee in the department he began beating the table and holding forth: "Medicine is easy! just make sure the air is going in and out, and the blood is going round and round!" There was much laughter. The next day I needed his help with a deteriorating patient, and I often think about our exchange:


```
ME (worried): I need help... cardiac failure... GI bleed... [blah blah ...]
CONSULTANT: Is the air going in and out?
ME: (confused) ...uh, yeah...
CONSULTANT: Good. Is the blood going round and round?
Me: ...uh, well he's been transfused 9 units and the blood pressur –
CONSULTANT (interrupting): Make the blood go round and round!
```

Gripped by terror, I couldn't see it at the time, but he was on to something. The problem *was* complex, with lots of details, numbers and twists in the story. But on another, deeper level, it was quite simple: the patient will die if they can't breath or if their blood pressure crashes.

(Readers will be relieved to learn the patient survived. We gave him more blood, and used inotropes and vasopressors to keep it going round and round, buying time for the surgeons saved the day.)


\* *Literally the only time I saw him wearing trousers was when he had to give evidence to coroner.*

### People

This lesson in algorithmic thinking and recognising patterns was hammered home to me many more times as a doctor. And yet, the profession is anything but robotic. Good doctors understand people: combining knowledge and technical skills with difficult conversations and break bad news is at the heart of the craft. The same lessons hold true in business. 



#### A viewpoint:
Most organisational problems can be diagnosed by asking the following questions.


|               | Question                        |
| --------------|---------------------------------|
| __Vision__    | Is it compelling?               |
| __People__    | Are we looking after people?    |
| __Teams__     | Are we optimising for the team? |
| __Strategy__  | Is there focus?                 |
| __Execution__ | Are we learning fast enough?    |




Organisations that get these things right, win.
